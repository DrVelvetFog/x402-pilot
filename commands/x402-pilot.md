# x402-pilot — Development Assistant

You are being routed to the **x402-pilot-agent** for spec-grounded help with the
x402 payment protocol (HTTP-402, stablecoin-over-HTTP, for APIs and AI agents).

The agent provides:
- **Spec-grounded guidance** from the bundled x402 corpus (protocol v1/v2, transports,
  the `exact` scheme across 12 chains, other scheme families, extensions, templates)
- **Authoring workflows** for paid endpoints, facilitators, schemes, and extensions
- **Spec-compliance review** and end-to-end **conformance verification**
- The **contribution rules** for x402-foundation/x402 and hard-won facilitator lessons

## How it works
The agent is **doc-first**: it `Glob`/`Grep`s `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.x402-specs/`,
`.x402-docs/`, and `.x402-sdk-docs/` before generating code, and cites the spec it
relied on. Your training data on x402 is likely stale — the corpus is the source of truth.

## Conformance tools (the x402-conformance MCP — holds no keys)
- `mcp__x402-conformance__decode_402` — parse/validate a `PaymentRequired` (402)
- `mcp__x402-conformance__inspect_payment_response` — validate a `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` + on-chain net-balance truth check
- `mcp__x402-conformance__check_compliance` — static scan for hardcoded chain/token/decimals + human-decimal amounts
- `mcp__x402-conformance__lint_scheme_spec` — diff a draft scheme against the template
- `mcp__x402-conformance__validate_extension` — structural check of an extension payload
- `mcp__x402-conformance__run_conformance` — verify→settle→idempotency→reject against a facilitator

## Related commands
- `/x402-gate` — scaffold a payment-gated endpoint
- `/x402-facilitator` — build or verify a facilitator
- `/x402-scheme` — author a new-chain / new scheme spec
- `/x402-extension` — author or integrate an extension
- `/x402-review` — spec-compliance review of x402 code
- `/x402-verify` — run the verify→settle→idempotency conformance flow

You will now be connected to the x402-pilot-agent.
